Hello ! My name is Marouene Boubakri, I'm an Embedded Security Engineer at NXP, I received an engineering degree in Digital Security from EURECOM, Graduate School and Research Center, located in Sophia Antipolis France. I have past experience working in the field of industry, academia and research. My research interests include most aspects of System Security. I also enjoy doing things in various fields like: Operating System Development, Linux Kernel internals, Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Bugs exploitation and other low-level stuff. From day to day I help my customers (Google, Samsung, Cisco, Sony ...) building secure products in top of i.MX Application Processors. When I have time (on weekends) I like playing hacking competitions (Capture The Flag contests). I am one of the founding members of Pwnium hacking group, with whom I participated and won many competitions. I also organized several competitions such as the worldwide Pwnium CTF. I'm the founder and chairman of Hackfest, tunisian national cybersecurity conference and competition. I adore cats. When I am not in front of my computer, I like to play ping-pong, biking, play music and take pictures along the way.
